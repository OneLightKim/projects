# web viewer with python

We created a web environment that can be provided to users through the django framework.
The screen composition is divided into a total of three depths. 
- First, decide which file to upload: hwpx, xlsx, pptx, or pdf.
- The second screen is to upload a file. A notice is provided that it cannot be executed unless it is a file in the correct format.
- Third, it is a screen that converts an Xml file through python and provides it.
